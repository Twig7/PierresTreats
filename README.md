## Description

This application will help Pierre list treats he has for sale and the flavors he's offering. Users will be able to register accounts and log in and out, and managers will have special access to edit content.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Clone repository.
- Open code in your favorite text editor. I use VS Code.
- Using MySQL Workbench, import amber_wilwand.sql to create a local instance of the database.
- Create an appsettings.json file in the/HairSalon directory, and input the code { "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=amber_wilwand;uid=root;pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD];" } }
- Make sure to replace 'YOUR-PASSWORD' with your MySQL Workbench password!
- Head back into the program you're running the code with, and run the command dotnet build in the terminal.
- Now run the command dotnet run, and enjoy pretending to babysit these machines!
